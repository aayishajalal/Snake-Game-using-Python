# Snake Game Using Python

## Project Overview

The **Snake Game** is a classic arcade game built using Python. It leverages the **Tkinter** module for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the **Random** module for randomizing the placement of food on the game board. This project allowed for hands-on experience in developing a GUI-based application with interactive elements.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** The snake moves across the game board.
- **Food Generation:** Random food placement for the snake to consume.
- **Collision Detection:** Ends the game if the snake hits the walls or itself.
- **Interactive GUI:** Developed using Tkinter for a smooth user interface.
- **Game Over:** The game stops when the snake collides with itself or the walls.

## Gameplay

- The player controls the snake using arrow keys.
- The snake grows longer as it eats the food that appears on the screen.
- The game ends when the snake hits the boundaries of the game window or runs into its own body.
- The objective is to score as many points as possible by eating the food.
